Comment
1 MW PEM electrolyzer based on Niklas Gerloff, Comparative Life-Cycle-Assessment analysis of three major water electrolysis technologies while applying various energy scenarios for a greener hydrogen production, Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 43, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.102759. Lifetime of 7-8 years per single stack, @ 8000 hours/year. Iridium mining process is NOT from ecoinvent. Produced amount of H2 over 20 years: 2964315.35 kg. According to a study called IndWEDe, it is assumed that the stacks are replaced 3 times during the 20 years lifespan, based on the 2030’s scenario for 1 MW systems which predicts a lifetime of 50,000 h or more for the stacks of the different water electrolysis technologies. In comparison to AEC electrolyzers, PEMEC electrolyzers are less mature. Furthermore, the PEMEC technology is commercially available and operates with a similar system efficiency as the AEC technology. However, the current density and the gas purity are higher with values in between 0.6–2.0 A/cm2 and > 99.99%, respectively. Besides this, the operating pressure (below 200 bar) is significantly higher in comparison to AEC systems, while the operating temperature (50 °C to 80 °C) and the system energy (4.2–6.6 kWh/m3H2) are similar to AEC systems. The PEMEC BoP and stack components data stem from Bareiß et al. and correspond to a 1 MW system. Moreover, some further BoP components like water purifier & feed tank, buffer tank, and heat exchanger have been added, derived from a 300 kW AEC system, under the assumption that the components are also suitable for a PEMEC system. The values have been scaled up from 300 kW to 1 MW. Values have already been multiplied by 3 to reflect 2 stack replacements over 20 years of use.

Comment
1 MWe Alkaline electrolyzer based on Niklas Gerloff, Comparative Life-Cycle-Assessment analysis of three major water electrolysis technologies while applying various energy scenarios for a greener hydrogen production, Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 43, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.102759. Single stack lifetime of 7-8 years @ 8000 hours/year, hence 3 replacements over 20 years. Produced amount of H2 over 20 years: 3085961.12 kg. The technology is available for large plant sizes and operates with a stack efficiency of up to 67 % (based on the lower heating value (LHV) of the generated H2). The operating temperature is in between 60–80 °C, and the current density is around 0.2–0.4 A/cm2. Moreover, the system energy –including the stack and periphery energy– is in the range of 4.4–6.6 kWh/m3H2, while the gas purity is higher than 99.5%, and the operating pressure is below 30 bar. While the LCI data of the BoP components either originate from Zhang et al., based on a 300-kW system and, therefore, scaled-up to 1 MW by a factor of 0.7, the LCI data of the other BoP components originate from manufacturer offers or have been estimated by own calculations using additional information by the producers.  Values have already been multiplied by 3 to reflect 2 stack replacements over 20 years of use.

"LCI for a PEMFC fuel cell stack system. Operational time was set to 20,000 h at power of 1 kWe. Due to the degradation effects the hydrogen consumption must be increased to always generate the power of 1 kWe. In the case of dynamic operational regime 5 replacements (Nd = 5) of the PEMFC stack are included (lifetime of 3'800 hours per stack).

Comment
Based on stoichiometry, for every kilogram of methane produced, the system would consume approximately 2.75 kilograms of CO2 and 0.5 kilograms of H2, and produce approximately 2.25 kilograms of water. Rest of info taken from BioCat II project Annex I 2014. Consider 51.3 kg CH4 per full-load hour. Reactor heat re-circulated at the wastewater treatment plant, hence not considered here. Infrastructure missing. Source: https://energiforskning.dk/sites/energiforskning.dk/files/slutrapporter/12164_annex_1_p2g_biocat_lca_final_report.pdf

Comment
Capture of CO2 from a cement plant for subsequent reuse. It is a facility integrated in a synthetic fuel production chain, so a certain amount of the needed steam heat (used to regenerate the sorbent) can come from excess heat generated by the synfuel conversion process, the rest being complemented by a dedicated source. In Meunier et al. 2020, 26% comes from excess heat generated by the methanol production process. To be changed according to needs. Also, there is no need for water, as it is provided by the methanol production process as well. CO2 chemical absorption-regeneration process using amines as scrubbing solvent. The amine solution used for this absorption was an aqueous solution of monoethanolamine (MEA) in a mass concentration of 30 wt.%, widely studied and considered as a benchmark for industrial CO2 capture applications. The CO2 is pre-compressed at 2 bar before storage. 10% of the CO2 is released back into the atmosphere (because the CO2 absoprtion rate is only 90%). The MEA makeup has been considered to 1 kg MEA per ton captured CO2 to compensate the losses due to the thermal degradation of the amine only, as the evaporation of the amine in the absorber is prevented by a flash tank. The rate of fossil vs. biogenic CO2 received from the cement plant need to be reflected in this dataset in two places: at the leakage level, but also at the storage level. At the storage level, we only indicate biogenic CO2. By default, we asusme 20% of the CO2 emissions are biogenic. Source: Alternative production of methanol from industrial CO2. Meunier et al. 2020.

10.55 kW GSHP system operating in New Jersey, US. The system boundary spans the entire lifetime of a GSHP system, including: borehole drilling and heat exchanger installation, heat pump production and installation, system operation and maintenance, and end-of-life. The overall efficiency of the system was assumed to have a heating coefficient of performance (COPheating) of 3.5. The system life is assumed to be 25 years. For the ground loop installation, we assume two boreholes each drilled at a depth of 80 m to represent a vertical closed-loop system.

Comment
"10 kW WSHP system operating in the UK. The GSHP and WSHP use external heat
collectors which are normally installed bellow the ground or
submersed into the water body, respectively. The collectors consist or either a horizontal or vertical pipework loop with a heat-carrier working fluid. In this study, both configurations use a mixture of water and ethylene glycol as the working fluid. CoP in the UK of 3.9. Lifetime of 20 years.

10.55 kW GSHP system operating in New Jersey, US. The system boundary spans the entire lifetime of a GSHP system, including: borehole drilling and heat exchanger installation, heat pump production and installation, system operation and maintenance, and end-of-life. The overall efficiency of the system was assumed to have a heating coefficient of performance (COPheating) of 3.5. The system life is assumed to be 25 years. For the ground loop installation, we assume two boreholes each drilled at a depth of 80 m to represent a vertical closed-loop system.

"1 kg H2 produced by pyrolyzing methane. Pyrolysis processes decompose hydrocarbons into solid carbon and hydrogen at high temperatures (thermally or biologicalally). As no oxygen is present, no carbon oxides are formed, potentially eliminating the need for secondary processing steps such as the WGSR. The higher H2 concentration of the product gas stream also has considerable potential for minimising downstream clean-up processes. From a carbon-storage perspective, pyrolysis processes offer the advantage of storing a solid C-product as opposed to gaseous CO2. There is an allocation between the production of hydrogen and black carbon, based on their respective market value -- see Von Wald et al. 2020 for black carbon, and Florian Wirth, Green Hydrogen Production for Heavy-Duty Trucks, 2021, for hydrogen price in Switzerland.

The energy required is from DOI:10.1002/ceat.201600023. For pyrolysis, it can be provided both electrically and by burning some of the natural gas or pyrolysis products. For the comparison of technologies, electrical resistance heating is assumed, as use of this type of heating is deemed to be most practicable. The power requirement of 7.23 MWhel/ton H2 is based on thermodynamic calculations. These take into account both the energy losses during heat recovery and the compression power of 2 MWhel/ton H2, to compress pyrolysis hydrogen from 2 bar to 100 bar with three interim cooling stages. Inventories consolidated with numbers for infrastructures from Appendix A1 from Postels et al., 2016 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.167. Missing input of quartz for reactor, as unavailable in ecoinvent. "

Comment
"The MEA technology considered for this study is modelled after Tang and You, 2018, Reiter and Lindorfer, 2015. After flue gas condensation, the cooled flue gas is fed into a reactor containing a 30% MEA solution, which absorbs around 85–90% of the CO2, typically at 25 °C–50 °C at 1 bar. The process is exothermic. The CO2-rich solution is heated afterwards to 100–140 °C, and in a stripper at 1–2 bars the CO2 desorbs from the MEA and leaves saturated with water vapour. The water is then condensed from the CO2 stream, and the CO2 is compressed to around 150 bar for transporting in pipes or a lower pressure for local tank storage and shipment by truck. The recovered MEA is reused in the plant (Pour et al., 2018). About 4 kg of MEA is used per tonne of CO2, due to degradation (releasing around 0.1 kg NH3 per tonne CO2 captured), the formation of heat-stable salts and losses as vapour and aerosols during stripping (the latter is around 0.01 kg per tonne of CO2 captured). NaOH is added in the stripping step at an amount of 0.1 kg per tonne CO2 captured. Around 4 kg of solid waste is generated per tonne of CO2 captured; this waste is disregarded. The MEA CC process also reduces the content of other pollutants in the flue gas, the extent of which depends on whether flue gas condensation is already in place or is introduced as part of the CO2 capture system. SOx, HCl, particulate matter and heavy metals are reduced to very low levels by flue gas condensation and subsequent CC. The level of NH3 increases in the flue gas after CC because of degradation of MEA. This is not included here. Source: Valentina Bisinella, Tore Hulgaard, Christian Riber, Anders Damgaard, Thomas H.

Comment
LCI of solution mining for the future storage of 1 kg of hydrogen. Includes mostly the water demand, the water injection and the brine pumping. We use tap water for now, which may not be entirely correct. The salt cavern is assumed to be 500,000 m3 large. The available hydrogen amount is 4,000 tons per year, with a lifetime of 40 years, for a total capacity of 6,350 tons per year. Hence the inputs are normalized by 4,000 tons * 40 years. Here are some additional parameters. Water demand 10 m³/m³ (Niquet, 1978), Water demand, total 5,000,000 m³, Capacity pump 570 kW (van Ohlen, 2015), Efficiency pump 76 % (Flowserve, 2015), Pumping rate, water 250 m³/h (van Ohlen, 2015), Time for solution mining 20,000 h, Electricity demand pump 750 kWh/h, Electricity demand, total 15,000 MWh Source: C.
